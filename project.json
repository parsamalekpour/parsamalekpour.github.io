      "challenge": "The original antenna control unit struggled with connection stability in harsh marine conditions (up to force 10 winds), used low-grade sensors that failed in high-vibration environments, and had monolithic firmware that was difficult to maintain and scale.",
      "solution": "We completely redesigned the system with industrial-grade sensors, implemented a 6-schedule PID loop with deterministic timing, added EKF-based sensor fusion for stability, and created a modular firmware architecture using FreeRTOS for better maintainability and scalability.",
